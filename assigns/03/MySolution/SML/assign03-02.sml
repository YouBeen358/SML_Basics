(*
A word here is defined to be a (possibly empty)
sequence of lowcase letters in the English alphabet.
Two words w1 and w2 are neighbors if they are of the
same length and differ by exactly one letter.
//
For instance, [water] and [later] are neighbors.
For instance, [abcde] and [abxde] are neighbors.
For instance, [abcde] and [abcde] are not neighbors.
//
Given a word, the function [word_neighbors] returns
a list consisting of *all* the neighbors of the word.
//
fun word_neighbors(word: string): string list = ...
//
Please give an implementation of word_neighbors.
Note that you are NOT allowed to define recursive functions
in your implementation.
